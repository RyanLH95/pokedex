# pokedex
My pokedex project featuring 151 Pokemon from generation 1. 

Design is based on the pokedex in the games and anime and is designed to function as such. The pokedex functions to
show the pokemon itself, it's dex information (name, species, height, weight and brief description of the pokemon), its typing
and it's dex number e.g. 025 is Pikachu and 150 is Mewtwo.

Side Note:
This only features pokemon from generation 1 and is based on generation 1, so any changes to the franchise beyond this generation
will not be included in this pokedex.

Also there is no definitive manual on how the pokedex works so all the buttons are functions are improvised.

This is a brief manual on the pokedex:


RED BUTTON (on the screen <div>) = turn on pokedex

BIG BLUE BUTTON = enter(from when dex number is either typed or input from the number buttons)

DIRECTIONAL BUTTONS = To move up and down pokedex

NUMBER BUTTONS = To input pokemon's dex number

NAV BUTTONS (buttons with arrows on them) = to switch between dex info e.g. name - specs - description


Hope you like the project and it's design. Feedback is always welcome.
